1. Introduction

   
The purpose of this project was to build on the work done in Part 1 by adding logic, interactivity, and navigation to the mobile app using TypeScript and React Native (Expo).
The project demonstrates the ability to:
‚Ä¢	Use core components to create a user interface.
‚Ä¢	Use layouts and colour schemes to enhance usability.
‚Ä¢	Handle text inputs and button presses.
‚Ä¢	Store and display user data temporarily using TypeScript variables.
‚Ä¢	Use if statements and basic logic.
‚Ä¢	Navigate between multiple screens in the app.
‚Ä¢	Apply animations to improve user experience.
The app is designed for a chef to create and manage a restaurant menu.

3. App Overview

   
App Name: Chef‚Äôs Menu Manager
Development Environment: Expo (TypeScript template)
Tools Used:
‚Ä¢	VS Code
‚Ä¢	Expo CLI
‚Ä¢	React Navigation
‚Ä¢	React Native Picker
‚Ä¢	OBS (for screen recording)
The app consists of four screens:
1.	Home Screen ‚Äì Displays all menu items and the total number of dishes.
2.	Add Menu Screen ‚Äì Allows the chef to enter dish details (name, description, course, and price).
3.	Menu Details Screen ‚Äì Displays detailed information about a selected dish.
4.	About Screen ‚Äì Provides app and developer information.

3. Features Implemented

   
Feature	Description	Evidence / Code Reference
Text Inputs	Used to enter dish name, description, and price.	AddMenuScreen.tsx
Picker (Select Course)	Predefined list: Starters, Mains, Dessert.	AddMenuScreen.tsx
TypeScript Variables	Menu items stored in a useState<MenuItem[]> array.	HomeScreen.tsx
Button Presses	‚ÄúAdd Dish‚Äù navigates and saves input.	Button component in AddMenuScreen
Navigation	Stack navigation between all four screens.	App.tsx
Conditional Logic (if statements)	Validation to ensure all fields are filled before saving.	AddMenuScreen.tsx
Animations	Fade-in animation for menu items.	HomeScreen.tsx using Animated.View
Colour Scheme and Layout	Consistent theme with contrasting buttons.	Global styles
Responsive Layout	Uses ScrollView and View for flexible design.	All screens







5. Programming Concepts Demonstrated
   
a. Variables and State Management
Each menu item is stored using React‚Äôs useState hook:
const [menuItems, setMenuItems] = useState<MenuItem[]>([]);
b. Input Handling
Form inputs update local state dynamically:
onChangeText={(text) => setDishName(text)}
c. Conditional Logic
Validates data before adding to list:
if (!name || !description || !price) {
  alert("Please fill in all fields");
  return;
}
d. Navigation

Screens are linked using React Navigation Stack:
navigation.navigate("AddMenu");
e. TypeScript Interfaces

Reusable type for all menu data:
export interface MenuItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  course: Course;
  price: number;
}



 6. User Interface Design
    
‚Ä¢	Colours: Earth tones (green, brown, white) for a kitchen feel.
‚Ä¢	Typography: Clear, large text for readability.
‚Ä¢	Layout: Flexbox for consistent spacing.
‚Ä¢	Buttons: Rounded with shadows for modern look.
‚Ä¢	Animations: Subtle fade and scaling when adding dishes.

 8. App Navigation Flow
Home Screen
   ‚Üì
Add Menu Screen ‚Üí Save Item ‚Üí Back to Home (Item Added)
   ‚Üì
Menu Details Screen (on item press)
   ‚Üì
About Screen

 9. Testing and Debugging
‚Ä¢	Testing environment: Expo Go (Android device).
‚Ä¢	Errors Fixed:
o	Import paths for screens corrected ('./screens/...').
o	Added missing dependencies (@react-navigation/native, @react-native-picker/picker).
o	Cleared cache using npx expo start -c to fix bundler issues.
‚Ä¢	Validation Testing:
o	Ensured blank fields trigger alerts.
o	Price input restricted to numbers only.
o	Menu items correctly appear on the Home Screen after saving.

10. Video Demonstration
A screen recording was created using OBS showing all app features:
‚Ä¢	App launch
‚Ä¢	Adding new menu items
‚Ä¢	Viewing item list and total count
‚Ä¢	Viewing details page
‚Ä¢	Navigating to About screen

 11. Reflection

     
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:
‚Ä¢	Structuring a React Native app in TypeScript.
‚Ä¢	Handling input validation and state updates.
‚Ä¢	Using navigation and UI layouts.
‚Ä¢	Debugging Expo environment issues.
‚Ä¢	Writing cleaner, modular code using separate files for screens and types.
In future work, I would improve by adding data persistence using AsyncStorage or a database.
